<p>I am loyal, honest, funny (it can happen:)) I have been known to hold a grudge :-/ and have completely fallen in love with being a mama and staying home. I'd flatteringly consider myself an "opt-out" mom where I set myself up for an incredibly fulfilling career in research and then SMACK! I fell in love with our little boy Noah more.</p>
<p>Fast forward 10 years where we now have 4 kiddosÂ  - yep 4!!!! Our little man is the oldest at 8 and our girls are 2,4 and 6 - and I have to tell you NONE of them were planned! Our littles were both birth control epic fails as our IUD and then our vasectomy didn't take!</p>
<p>Once we recovered from all of that! we happily have a big, boisterously fun-loving family that pretty much makes its' own party :) Our family motto: GO BIG OR GO HOME! is one to live by!!</p>
<p>Mommy Knows Best is our successes and fails through our tried and true mom-certified products that really make a difference!</p>
<p>Xoxo,</p>
