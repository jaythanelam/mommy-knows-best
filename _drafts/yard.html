<p>Ohhhh I use to judge! So so judgy! We would drive past a house completely overcome with kid toys and flotsam and I would think - "wow! Look how they've let themselves go!"</p>
<p>I'm feeling now - mid 30s w/ 4 kids and a complete mess! That some of that judge-y-ness is a rite of passage in life - at least that's what I'm hoping. As we just added this monstrosity to our Arsenal of summertime fun!</p>
