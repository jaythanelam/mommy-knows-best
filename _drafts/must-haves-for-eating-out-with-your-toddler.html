<p>Soooo you're feeling brave and ready to head out to eat. Read on for your MUST HAVES to make it a smooth sailing adventure</p>
<p>1. Blanket - yep the blanket solves several of life's issues. Upset baby - give her the blanket. High chair too big - bolster with the blanket. Screaming toddler won't settle - throw the blanket over her head and run like hell!</p>
<p>2. Sticky placemats - These are brilliant! They literally stick to the table so that your little one immediately gets a clean surface asap. Most mats are color readying that your little one can start coloring right away but they're also great for small snacks pre-meal to help you get to the real food part.</p>
<p>3. Water - I NEVER leave home without our own water bottle. The restaurant cups are never dependable and it stinks to be in a situation where your independent little just wants a drink. Avoid the tantrum and bring a sippy cup.</p>
