<p>Failure is something we're taught at a very young age to avoid at all costs. You trip and fall - walking so hard FAIL You try a new job and get fired FAIL How hard is it to watch your kids fail!?! Ima played in her first indoor soccer tournament today and as the score quickly tallied against her team and she was called, yet again! for a handball (remember I said soccer right!?!) The war inside of me raged... Which mama do I need to be? The "hang your head low" mama or the "much needed direction" mama.... I decided some back seat coaching was more in line - screaming "You can't touch the BALL!!" Maybe not my best parenting moment... How hard is it to watch your kid struggle! Man!!</p>
<p>I debated between good and evil the entire game only to see her face at the end - the score a wapping 17-3 when she comes running up with a mega-whatt smile,"Wasn't that THE best!!" she says "Totally!' I reply. Let's go home.</p>
<p>And as we file 2 by 2 home Jaythan and I, the littles, the bigs, I'm reminded that some lessons are just harder for parents....</p>
