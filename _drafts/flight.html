<p>OH MY! Flight trampoline park is da bomb! We snagged their groupon and hit Open jump over New Years and it was such a hi! Bounce until you can't move the kids totally blew off steam</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My mom use to tell me that there were 2 kinds of people in this world - the movers and the shakers - Ok maybe it was the movers and the shakers and the non-movers but I feel like once you hit 35 - there really should only be one type of person and that's a mover! So let's go with that.</p>
<p>You want that body! That tiny bottom minus the jiggle - YOU GOTTA MOVE! And it doesn't matter where or how just get up! You like the gym so you can surround yourself with hard body's! GO! You like to be outside and run for the moment! Do IT!</p>
<p>Today, we tried out Flight Trampoline. It's a wall to wall warehouse where you can jump until you're weak in the knees! I jumped my heart out!</p>
<p>Hope you found your move today!</p>
