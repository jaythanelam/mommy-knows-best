<p>I am constantly checking in with the kids: How was your day? Who'd you play with? Don't do drugs! (ok that last part's a little early for my family but you get the gist)</p>
<p>I hate to say it but I'm less focused on the academics at this point and more looking to bolster their sense of self. The emotional well being part - the what makes you YOU! is one of the biggest gifts you can give your kiddos. If being a mother's taught me anything, it's that we all just want to be heard and cherished for ourselves.</p>
<p>Anywho, this all started to come to a head as I'm trying to discern how to design a nice inexpensive, theme-y room decor that matches each kiddos personality. My 2 and 4 year olds share a room and have yet to graduate from the cute baby bunnies and giraffes of their nursery but my bigs! OHHHHH I need some help!</p>
<p>My oldest daughter, Imagen, is so outwardly bright and bubbly was easy. We mixed pink with gold accents to come up with a shiny sparkly - somewhat funky - look.</p>

<p>But my son Noah (just turned 9) is a complete stumper! He is quickly outgrowing his race car bed and the 30 different art projects he has taped to the walls, have definitely started to see better days. I'm at a complete loss for what to!! Anyone have a good theme that can grow with the ages!?!</p>
