I'm 35 and I feel like for the first time, I'm finding my path. No - not finding. I'm deciding my path. I grew up with such a picturesque childhood. My Mom is strong - Army strong actually and my Dad's patient and loving. My entire life has been an expectation steppingstone. High school led to college led to grad school led to marriage led to kids. 10 years have gone by since we started our family and I decided to stay home.

Now SMACK! I'm back to the WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO!?! stage. It's been soooo long since I was able to entertain just what exactly makes me happy - without all the strings. Without all the expectations. You know what I've found - I LOVE STAYING HOME! I love the freedom of making up what I want to do everyday! I love being immersed in my kids lives and learning. I LOVE IT! I want to share that! Find others who have that same love. So here I am - reaching out to other moms! Other families that love and struggle and endure and still laugh at the end of it all :):)

> We are the music makers,<br />
> And we are the dreamers of dreams,<br />
> Wandering by lone sea-breakers,<br />
> And sitting by desolate streams;â€”<br />
> World-losers and world-forsakers,<br />
> On whom the pale moon gleams:<br />
> Yet we are the movers and shakers<br />
> Of the world for ever.<br />
> Edward Elgar's The Music Makers, Op. 69.
