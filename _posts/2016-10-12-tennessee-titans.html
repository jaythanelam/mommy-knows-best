<p>A new study just came out about how<a href="http://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/everything-kids/happiest-parents-have-four-or-more-kids-study-says/"> larger families are happier</a> YAY! Finally support for the other side LOL! and not just large but 4 or more kiddos! My interest was peaked! Of course the caveat to this experiment is that these parents are happier because they <em>planned</em> a large family, <em>had</em> a large family, and then reaped the rewards of that big ass family... J and I didn't ever plan the "party of 6" so where are we on that happiness meter!?!</p>
<p>I'd say we're getting there ;)</p>
<p>This move - the one back to our roots that speaks to my soul, the one that's all "Lean-In" to my role as a mom, really was a quit move. It meant no school. It meant no career move. It meant no working my way up the cooperate ladder but who am I kidding, I hate climbing ;)</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it's been a breath! A breath towards family, towards getting set-up and settled, towards fully embracing the fact that i'm a cookie baking, mommy cleaning, butt wiping machine. And the fun moments, the giggles and forts in bed and wide open adventures, those are all mine. My full plate.</p>
<p>So HI FROM TENNESSEE! Here we go!</p>
