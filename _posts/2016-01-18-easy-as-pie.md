We're off today - well never really off, as you Stay At Home Mamas know! But off meaning there is an entire 12 hour period ahead where I need to seriously up my game! Unfortunately for us, it's brutally cold outside and this mama has no reasonable want to venture out - so we're stuck with a day of TV, Pinterest, and baked goods :):)

I head into our craft bin and surface with 4 small travel puzzles, a bake-at-home bread mix and some markers - the kids go nuts! I mean wild, excited, <strong><em>play with me</em> <em>mom :-O</em></strong> nuts and it hits me; how great is this moment!?! How incredible is it to actually be someone's (in my case 4 someone's) ultimate hero! I won't delude myself into thinking this will last forever; they grow, they mature :) But today, with the wind howling and the fire popping and our little puzzle pieces spread all over the floor, I am that hero and this parenting thing, doesn't seem all that hard. I get to soak up all this love and attention, literally bask in the utter happiness where I know that, to them, I'm the greatest most wonderful person; <em><strong>to them - I'm the hero</strong></em> and that makes this staying at home thing seem like a piece of cake ;)

xoxo,
Jen
