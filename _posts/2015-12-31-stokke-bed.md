I love fun, modern "grow with you" furniture but Stokke's modular bedding stinks. Â The cool factor of having a round crib and the picturesque bassinet speak volumes but let me tell you - from someone who has held on top the damn thing throughout the growth process just to get my money's worth - IT BLOWS! The sheet is impossible to fit right where you are literally wrestling a bear to fit it on! Throw 2 toddlers into the mix and it's a free-for-all!

Skip this one and go for the babies-r-us version - you'll thank me ;)
