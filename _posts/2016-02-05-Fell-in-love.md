I love this - and not just for it's obvious meaning of putting the phone down and dialing into what ever isÂ in front of you - but for the explicit purpose of taking a breath, a minute, an instant to just be! It can be a thankful minute. A minute that you're reading this and you give thanks that you are healthy, you have a roof over your head and clothes for you and your kids or maybe you're not healthy. Maybe you're suffering and dragging around a burden that is unseen but continues to weigh on you still. Either way, take a second to find your positive. To give yourself a pat on the back for getting up this morning and taking a step forward! Unplug for a second and look at those babies in front of you...

Xoxo,
Jen
