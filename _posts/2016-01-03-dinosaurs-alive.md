[Discover the Dinosaurs!](http://www.discoverthedinosaurs.com/)Â was such a hit for our family! The entire exhibit was set up to be truly interactive and the life-size models were simply awesome! We walked through completely immersed in each scene as the brachiosaurus and T-Rex roared and leaned toward us! Noah, our resident 9-year old soaked up the interactive controllers where he could manipulate each gargantuan model to move and roar! A ride on Stegosaurus and keep-your-find fossil dig wrapped the day for us!!

Definitely gets this mommy's seal of approval!!
