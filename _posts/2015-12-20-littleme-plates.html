<p>Soo we're a big family. A big loud crazy - shield your children because we're coming down the aisle  - family.  At this point our kiddos are completely nutballs about ANYTHING with their names on it. They love embroidery - a little string goes along way, they love engraving, but what they love <em>most</em> is having their very own built-to-look-like-you tools at dinner! Everyone knows exactly which set is theirs so knows what and how much of everything they're getting and how to get that to the table and set!  It's brilliant!</p>
<p>These <a href="http://www.littlemeplates.com/dinnerware-sets/#/home" target="_blank">Little Me plates</a> are wonderful! They are microwaveable, dishwasher safe and have lasted for several key cycles through our family meals. Each of my kiddos has a plate and bowl set! <a href="http://www.littlemeplates.com/dinnerware-sets/#/product/125">Check it out here!</a></p>

<p>But most importantly, LittleMe's customer service cannot be beat! I went through several revisions and edits to get each of my kiddos personalities to come through.  We did superhero for my 6 year old and chef for my son and worked shades of eye color to match the not so cookie cutter grey :) LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!</p>
