<p>People ask us ALL THE TIME how we travel with 4... I'm not gonna lie - it takes alittle planning and a lot of luck!! I start with a small backpack for each kiddo that is tailored just for them. Our oldest Noah loves to play games on his phone so he has a lined pocket where he can store electronics. Imagen loves to bring her stuffed animal so she has a backpack that straps Miss Kitty outside leaving ample space in.  [amazon template=iframe image1&amp;asin=B000JJK9EY] Our biggest hurdle use to be car seats! They're crazy expensive to rent and most of the time are expired, recalled or just plane filthy! (Did you get it!!?! JUST <em>PLANE</em> :):) Anyways, we need 4 (count-em 4!) car seats no matter where we go and when I found these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Go-Go-Babyz-QRKIDZ-Travelmate-Black/dp/B000JJK9EY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452281190&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Go+go+Kidz">GOGO Kidz</a> wheels I wanted to kiss the ground right behind my happy hubby and delightfully happy toddlers. The wheels fit to your existing car seat, letting your little tyke get a front row seat straight to the gate! The entire thing is gate-check-approved so after you've survived the flight and patted your self on the back for a job well done, you're ready-to-roll back though the airport and strap into your rental! LOVE!LOVE!LOVE!</p>
