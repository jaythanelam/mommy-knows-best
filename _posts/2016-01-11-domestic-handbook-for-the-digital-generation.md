<p>I think there is a movement or "home-maker evolution" swinging away from an all-in career. Unapologetically looking to get back to raising a family and finding a balance between work and the investment into what makes your home a home."The rules of homemaking have changed. Today's generation of women are uber-connected and mostly employed, yet still seek to make their lives at home more creative."</p>

<p>At least that's what Brit Morin's "HomeMakers, a domestic handbook for the digital generation" is touting and I'm not gonna lie - I loved it! Not only did she break down some super cute DIY - her quick tutorial on how to put together a plated cake stand was a hit at our New Year's Eve party! but her unique understanding into the constant tug between staying at home and staying relevant was an insightful and easy read.</p>
