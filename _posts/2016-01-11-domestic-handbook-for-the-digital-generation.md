I think there is a movement or "home-maker evolution" swinging away from an all-in career. Unapologetically looking to get back to raising a family and finding a balance between work and the investment into what makes your home a home. "The rules of homemaking have changed. Today's generation of women are uber-connected and mostly employed, yet still seek to make their lives at home more creative."

At least that's what Brit Morin's "HomeMakers, a domestic handbook for the digital generation" is touting and I'm not gonna lie - I loved it! Not only did she break down some super cute DIY - her quick tutorial on how to put together a plated cake stand was a hit at our New Year's Eve party! but her unique understanding into the constant tug between staying at home and staying relevant was an insightful and easy read.

Pintrest on paper!
