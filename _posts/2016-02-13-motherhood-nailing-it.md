I love this! There are so many days where I feel like the pressure to not only have a great day but to have the most stupendous day! Where the kids are learning and growing and have everything they could possibly need - met at the exact time they could need it! - is SUCH a huge weight! So today, maybe shift that perspective and say YEP! NAILED IT!
