For all you breastfeeding moms out these are fantastic! [They are reusable silicone nipple pads that help to hold your let-down until it's time to nurse](https://www.fashionnova.com/products/petal-pushers-breast-petal-nude) - an invaluable tool to not only protect every precious drop of milk but also as a leak deterrent! It only has to happen once for you to want something in place to help and these never let me down!

Mommy Knows Best seal of approval!
