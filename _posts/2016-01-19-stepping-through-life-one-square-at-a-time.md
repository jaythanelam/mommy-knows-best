<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-292" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image-24-233x300.jpeg" alt="image" width="233" height="300" />OHHHHHHH how I miss the early days! Those lazy weekends in our tiny apartment. Our furniture: found, donated, inherited - all haphazardly thrown together to make that space <strong><em>our space</em></strong>. Jaythan and I playing house, feeling as if we had indeed accomplished "the dream" - GHAH! Flash forward 15 years and we ain't playin no more! Now,we have the whole kit-and-caboodle! The mortgage, the dog and the 2.5 kids (ok we doubled down on the kiddos :):)  We have this wonderful house and thankfully the space for all of us, but it comes with a big UGLY blight that has pretty much become the bain of my existence! It's the family room! DUN DUN DAAAAUUUUNNNNN!</p>
<p>The oblonged L-shaped room NEVER fits with the "how-to set your living room" guides. The 8x10s never reach our couch and all four feet on the rug FORGETTABOUTIT! We've tried a 9x12 but it hits the corners where the walls randomly jut out! Hence my search and finally the end-all-be-all solution to kids+crazy room = FLOR TILE! 3x3 tiles that fit together seamlessly in ANY configuration you want and ANY design you could want them! [amazon template=iframe image1&amp;asin=B00S1QZQZO]</p>
<p>1. Spill - what spill!?! Just take out a square and move on!</p>
<p>2. Funky? Stade? Elegant? All can be accomplished with this Flor tile!</p>
<p>3. Dog scoots across the rug - pop out the square and clean it!</p>
<p>4. Wanna make it more funky! Cut a bold color in half and line it throughout.</p>
<p>5. Style and restyle the room to mold different shapes!</p>
<p>6. Creat a rug walkway to attach one space to the next.</p>
<p>LOVE IT!</p>
