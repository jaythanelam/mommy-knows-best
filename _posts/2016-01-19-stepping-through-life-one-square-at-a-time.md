OHHHHHHH how I miss the early days! Those lazy weekends in our tiny apartment. Our furniture: found, donated, inherited - all haphazardly thrown together to make that space <strong><em>our space</em></strong>. Jaythan and I playing house, feeling as if we had indeed accomplished "the dream" - GHAH! Flash forward 15 years and we ain't playin no more! Now,we have the whole kit-and-caboodle! The mortgage, the dog and the 2.5 kids (ok we doubled down on the kiddos :):)  We have this wonderful house and thankfully the space for all of us, but it comes with a big UGLY blight that has pretty much become the bain of my existence! It's the family room! DUN DUN DAAAAUUUUNNNNN!

The oblonged L-shaped room NEVER fits with the "how-to set your living room" guides. The 8x10s never reach our couch and all four feet on the rug FORGETTABOUTIT! We've tried a 9x12 but it hits the corners where the walls randomly jut out! Hence my search and finally the end-all-be-all solution to kids+crazy room = FLOR TILE! 3x3 tiles that fit together seamlessly in ANY configuration you want and ANY design you could want them!

<p>
  1. Spill - what spill!?! Just take out a square and move on!<br />
  2. Funky? Stade? Elegant? All can be accomplished with this Flor tile!<br />
  3. Dog scoots across the rug - pop out the square and clean it!<br />
  4. Wanna make it more funky! Cut a bold color in half and line it throughout.<br />
  5. Style and restyle the room to mold different shapes!<br />
  6. Creat a rug walkway to attach one space to the next.<br />

LOVE IT!
