Resources and opportunity mamas! <em>That</em> is really what it comes down to when you have kiddos. Let's be honest, it's hard to find great teaching tools, a fun environment and not gasp at the sticker shock... That's why I <em>had</em> to share this shoe tying class offered by Nordstrom (yep the fancy store that gives away balloons!) They offer a class once a month for kiddos to learn to bunny year with the best of 'em. Not only did we learn to tie (something I've been trying to teach my 7 year old for MONTHS!) but we walked away with a little "I DID IT!" certificate, a goody bag packed with cute kiddo yummies and a discount on kids shoes! <u>all completely free!</u>Â It was fantastic! WE skipped out of there with HUGE smiles - Me not believing how great it all turned out and Ima with a renewed confidence, sucking a lollipop and holding her balloon wearing her just laced sneakers!

Definitely gets the mommyknowsbest seal of approval!

Happy Weekend!
