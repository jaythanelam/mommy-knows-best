Oh my goodness my heart has just opened today.  I started the morning at 2 with the last of our 4 kiddos coming down with a stomach bug.  I was almost relieved to hear the cry as it meant we can finally start to move on with our lives! We celebrated the new year with the blinds down and everyone piled on the couch - sick but together. I logged onto FaceBook and clipped onto a post about another mama with a tummy troubled family. Her post started out like I felt, with the tired yucky stupid stomach sweeping their family, but but then she turned it into an entirely new blessing when she expanded her hurt with those mama's who cope with littles that are terminally ill. For the family's that are sick not just this week but every week and my heart just poured out to the stories that many began to share, about warrior mama's that fight everyday for health and happiness.  Her pledge to love and prayer for each family was truly inspiring! We're all family!
