The fir inside is marvelously luxurious (a great option for irritable skin) and the outer shell works as a perfect wind deterrent. The colors are vivid and distinct - my 4 year old picked pink and fits in the 3-4 with just alittle length in the sleeves. If you're on the lookout for a new coat, grab it!

Your little one will thank you!
