![Bumbo seat](https://jaythanelam.github.io/mommy-knows-best/assets/images/bumboseat.jpg "Bumbo seat")

This is by far the best purchase you can make at the babys' 6 month crisis. Â At this point, you're in the trenches with sleep still not set and your kiddo flailing around like a fish. The Bumbo seat is pure awesomeness! This little chair helps your little one sit up my himself for the first time UNASSISTED! Which after months of floor watching is HUGE!

I love that it's waterproof (easy clean up) and it's a great bath idea with a little water at the bottom of the tub and you're cool in with crisco! The tray is invaluable as you can put toys, blocks, Cheerios! right at grasping level!

Little caveat - NEVER! Leave your little one on a high surface alone in one of these or any other seat! It's a mad mad world out there and you just can't images the theatrics your babe could come up with! Be safe.
