I realize this is a little off the beaten path from our baby-product-bonanza, but our puppy Bear is literally a part of our family and when he flies around while we're driving, it stresses me out!

Now, as you know our family motto is: "GO BIG! OR GO HOME!" and we did just that when we bought our cute little ball of fur last Christmas.  Bear is decidedly bigger now :):O

I started looking for a doggy-seatbelt and was really surprised at how many don't hold up in the event of a crash.  I mean really, if it's going to break when things go south, why even go through with the trouble... That's when I found the <a href="http://sleepypod.com/">Sleepy Pod</a>'s line of harnesses, I was completely impressed with the craftsmanship of the material as well as the customer service (they walked me through what Bear would need - no easy task coming at it from opposite ends of the country)

The Sleepy Pod car seats are one of the only seatbelts PROVEN to hold up in the event of a crash!

I love that we can drive and EVERYONE stays safe :)
