People ask us ALL THE TIME how we travel with 4... I'm not gonna lie - it takes alittle planning and a lot of luck!! I start with a small backpack for each kiddo that is tailored just for them. Our oldest Noah loves to play games on his phone so he has a lined pocket where he can store electronics. Imagen loves to bring her stuffed animal so she has a backpack that straps Miss Kitty outside leaving ample space in. Our biggest hurdle use to be car seats! They're crazy expensive to rent and most of the time are expired, recalled or just plane filthy! (Did you get it!!?! JUST <em>PLANE</em> :):) Anyways, we need 4 (count-em 4!) car seats no matter where we go and when I found theseÂ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Go-Go-Babyz-QRKIDZ-Travelmate-Black/dp/B000JJK9EY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452281190&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Go+go+Kidz">GOGO Kidz</a> wheels I wanted to kiss the ground right behind my happy hubby and delightfully happy toddlers. The wheels fit to your existing car seat, letting your little tyke get a front row seat straight to the gate! The entire thing is gate-check-approved so after you've survived the flight and patted your self on the back for a job well done, you're ready-to-roll back though the airport and strap into your rental! LOVE!LOVE!LOVE!
