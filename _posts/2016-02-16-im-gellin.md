I absolutely love my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004P1I73M/ref=twister_B00G6H5QHS?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1">GelPro mat</a>! We use one in the kitchen and another in the laundry. I can't say enough about the back aches these little wonders have saved me from! The gel core has been proven to reduce fatigue and stress on joints so spaces where I'm standing for long periods of time i.e. the stove and the washing machine (you would feint at the multitude of laundry it takes to keep us running) - are a welcome relief! Love! Love! Love!
