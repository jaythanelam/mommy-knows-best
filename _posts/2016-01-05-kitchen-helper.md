We so often have to find a slot to fit what we "as mothers" are.  I am a stay at home mom. I am an accountant. A negotiator. An excellent communicator. But something many of you may not know is that at my heart, I am a baker. I have honed my love of sweets to fulfill several roles in our family albeit a teaching tool, a housewarming gift, a comfort food, or a simple gift. What I love most about baking is bonding with the kids! (Alright maybe not my MOST favorite as I've already said - Mama loves the sweet stuff!!). I figure you get alittle math (fractions from the measuring cups) work alittle hand eye coordination (stirring requires great insight and focus) and wrap the whole thing with giggles as we sample the fruits of our labor. Ahhhhh memories! Back in the day I struggled with our then 2 year old son Noah, worrying that he'd fall or that he'd be on top of our counter literally IN the secret sauce.

That's when I found this [KITCHEN HELPER](https://www.amazon.com/Guidecraft-15924W-Kitchen-Helper-Natural/dp/B000SQNAQC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483327222&sr=8-1&keywords=Guidecraft+Kitchen+Helper) stand and it's been a staple ever since. We still have it snugged under our bartop 10 years later!! It's invaluable space-saving design allows you to store it out of the way with and the easy fold out is a quick solution to little helping hands. I love that our 2 year old can climb up to the counter and help us bake without me having to worry about her tumbling off a step stool.

Seriously brilliant add!!!!!
