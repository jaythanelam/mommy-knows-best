I started out in the sciences. I LOVED the "why's" of how the world fit together and the elemental building blocks that work together to make a whole. Funnily enough, it's not that far off from where I am now, only instead of basic elements - we're growing little people :) We have 4 kiddos - 2,4,6 and 8 - who at any given moment astound, inspire, aggravate, and completely humble me.

I've just started this blog and already it's already given me a voice to share those moments - the ups and down, successes and mondo fails :0 Thanks for going on this journey with me!
