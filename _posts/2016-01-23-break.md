I went out tonight and it seemed the entire city of DC was on pause. It was just peacefully quiet in a soothing-of-your-soul kinda way and just for a moment, I let go of all the little nagging expectations and self-doubt that were keeping me from my happiness. In that moment, I let go of the expectation to have a better body; to eat better, to drink less. To pick up those socks on the floor or straighten out the towels in the bathroom. In that moment I decided that if the whole city could break for the weekend, I could give myself a little break. A free pass to let the kids just be kids. Let them craft and paint and play and build until we  come out of this on the other side. Mess be damned 😛

It was shocking to realize how much all those expectations weighed! How much those silly details take up! So this weekend, I'm going to let it all go...

I wonder what kind of woman I'll be on the other side 😝😝

xoxo,
