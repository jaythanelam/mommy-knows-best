<p>This is by far the best purchase you can make at the babys' 6 month crisis. Â At this point, you're in the trenches with sleep still not set and your kiddo flailing around like a fish. The Bumbo seat is pure awesomeness! This little chair helps your little one sit up my himself for the first time UNASSISTED! Which after months of floor watching is HUGE!</p>

<p>I love that it's waterproof (easy clean up) and it's a great bath idea with a little water at the bottom of the tub and you're cool in with crisco! The tray is invaluable as you can put toys, blocks, Cheerios! right at grasping level!</p>
<p>Little caveat - NEVER! Leave your little one on a high surface alone in one of these or any other seat! It's a mad mad world out there and you just can't images the theatrics your babe could come up with! Be safe.</p>
