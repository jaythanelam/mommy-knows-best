Alright team, I've tried! GOD KNOWS I'VE TRIED! I've embraced staying at home. I continue to remind myself that I <em>chose</em> to do this. I CHOOSE THIS LIFE! So WHY!! WHHHHHYYYYY friends am I stuck in a hot kitchen with the smell of burnt chocolate all around me miserably trying to smoosh M&amp;Ms into hard angry won't-melt-AT-ALL! treats for Harley's preschool snack! WHY???

These are the adorable pics - The Pinterest "it's so easy" pics.

OHHHH ladies WHY!?!?!?!?

On the bright side, these were my testers. Â So I have 3 more days until I throw in the towel and head to the store to get green frosted sugar cookies but I'm trying (there's points for that right?)

Happy Monday y'all!
