<p>My parents are in town... Does anyone else not get a thing done with family in town!!!?!? It's such a blessing to have them come up. We don't have live-in or even live-close grandparents so to have visiting-loving grandparents that are not only willing to take the kids but enjoy them while they're out! - it's a game changer *almost enough to make us want to move closer :)</p>
<p>Anyway, they have a way of throwing off my game ;/ so much that it's hard to even check in with mommyknowsbest.co. So, if you've been wondering if I fell off the face of the earth - I'm here! For you! For me, really, as this is basically helping to realign my sanity !!!! But I'm here. What's new?</p>
<p>xoxo,</p>
