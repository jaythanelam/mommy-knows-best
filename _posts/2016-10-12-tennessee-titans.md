A new study just came out about how<a href="http://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/everything-kids/happiest-parents-have-four-or-more-kids-study-says/"> larger families are happier</a> YAY! Finally support for the other side LOL! and not just large but 4 or more kiddos! My interest was peaked! Of course the caveat to this experiment is that these parents are happier because they <em>planned</em> a large family, <em>had</em> a large family, and then reaped the rewards of that big ass family... J and I didn't ever plan the "party of 6" so where are we on that happiness meter!?!

I'd say we're getting there ;)

This move - the one back to our roots that speaks to my soul, the one that's all "Lean-In" to my role as a mom, really was a quit move. It meant no school. It meant no career move. It meant no working my way up the cooperate ladder but who am I kidding, I hate climbing ;)

Surprisingly, it's been a breath! A breath towards family, towards getting set-up and settled, towards fully embracing the fact that i'm a cookie baking, mommy cleaning, butt wiping machine. And the fun moments, the giggles and forts in bed and wide open adventures, those are all mine. My full plate.

So HI FROM TENNESSEE! Here we go!
