<p>I'm in my first stretch in 10 (YES 10!) years without having a baby so instead of producing yet another member to our ever growing Team Elam band, I'm starting MOMMY KNOWS BEST for everything great and good and beneficial about having a family! There are sooooo many sales out there, sales to buy for comfort, for savings, for economics and the bottom line is - Â you just don't need them all! - not by a long shot! So here I am, with a hard earned decade behind me to share with you the fun and functional things that really do make a difference and that get the <a href="http://www.mommyknowsbest.co">Mommy Knows Best</a> seal of approval!</p>
<p>xoxo,</p>
