Ahhhh it's been a day - and still shy of 11am! If ever I wanted to slip some Kaluha in my coffee, it's now. My kiddos completely rebelled this am. Our son, in true big brother fashion, obnoxiously picked on his sisters - breaking each one down to tears. As I put him on the bus, sulking after losing his screen time for the week,Â I closed my eyes, took a breath, and headed back in to get my littles (4 and 3) ready for preschool. My 3 year old, Ever picked up where her brother left off (maybe this is a poltergeist situation:):) throwing down about having to wear pants! Squealing and crying getting her hair brushed. Kicking and screaming about putting on her coat.

To all you moms out there in this sisterhood. Who fought the good fight and made it through to your second cup of coffee, with or without the Kaluha, I salute you!

Xoxo,
