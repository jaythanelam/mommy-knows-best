<p>Ahhhh it's been a day - and still shy of 11am! If ever I wanted to slip some Kaluha in my coffee, it's now. My kiddos completely rebelled this am. Our son, in true big brother fashion, obnoxiously picked on his sisters - breaking each one down to tears. As I put him on the bus, sulking after losing his screen time for the week,Â I closed my eyes, took a breath, and headed back in to get my littles (4 and 3) ready for preschool. My 3 year old, Ever picked up where her brother left off (maybe this is a poltergeist situation:):) throwing down about having to wear pants! Squealing and crying getting her hair brushed. Kicking and screaming about putting on her coat.</p>
<p>To all you moms out there in this sisterhood. Who fought the good fight and made it through to your second cup of coffee, with or without the Kaluha, I salute you!</p>
<p>Xoxo,</p>
