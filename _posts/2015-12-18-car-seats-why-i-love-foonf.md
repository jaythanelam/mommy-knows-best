Let me start by saying that I am crazy about the new convertible car seat by Foonf! Love the fabric. Love the safety! Love everything! And while it is heavy as all hell, with that weight comes a true sense of security that is inevitably what you want in the event things go south. Don't get me wrong, I went through the Britax and Graco phase.[amazon template=iframe image1&amp;asin=B00LC92DVW]I tried the ergonomic handle, the narrower back for better comfort, the stylish yet undeniably heavy Peg Perego  - only to find that they all had the same underlining flaws, those seats are all made out of plastic and in the event of a car accident, that plastic snaps, breaks and ultimately degrades! Not to mention the straps in the back - whether they attach on both latch seats or not - NEVER get close enough to fit. You are FOREVER pushing and tugging so that the seat can fit just alittle tighter just a little better into those buckets! In this day and age where the new recs are for kids to be rear facing through 2 and to shed coats and outer layers to get a snugger fit, how many tugs does it take!?! those tugs really add up to make a difference!

[Foonf](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SH3MHEE/ref=twister_B00VA5TOHO?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1) takes out the guess work and the worry. Its' interior body is made up of steel (yep like the tried and true seat you're sitting in) and has been proven to stand up in the event of an accident. The rigid latch system slides then snaps into place, locking it, BOOM! The Seat itself has a narrower width allowing it to fit 3 across in a normal car! The crypton fabric is a waterproof marvel (hello superman!!) essentially shedding spills and wiping clean in a snap! What can I say, I'm Foonf crazy!
