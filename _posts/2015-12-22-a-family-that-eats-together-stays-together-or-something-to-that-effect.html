<p>I completely fell for the "Babies learn best right at the table with you" bit.  I literally clamped my little man (now 9) up onto our breakfast bar with a mat underneath and gave him EVERYTHING there.  We colored, we ate!, we played with blocks.  There was just something to having him right on our level that helped boost my confidence, he would pick up faster hand-eye coordination and figure out how to feed himself! I'm pretty sure they have long since recalled these seats - how dangerous is it to hike your baby 4 feet from the ground!!</p>

<p>And in its' stead, they have come up with something even better! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kaboost-Portable-Chair-Booster-Green/dp/B000V3YFJI/ref=sr_1_1?s=baby-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1450794691&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=kaboost">KABOOST</a> lets you use your existing dining room chairs literally lifting them to the table! It fits ALL 4 legged chairs, has a short and long side to give you wiggle room between ages (my 3 and 4 year olds use the higher side - my 7 year old only needs a little boost to the shorter side)</p>
<p>100% stamp of approval from jen@mommyknowsbest.co</p>
