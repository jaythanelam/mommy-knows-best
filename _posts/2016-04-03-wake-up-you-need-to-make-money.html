<p>I'm looking at going back to school. While it's been on the docket for awhile - ok, like a decade - I guess I need to get my big girl panties on and just get-er-done! Full Disclosure, even just typing the words "going back to school" makes my stomach roll. Don't get me wrong,</p>
<blockquote><p>I truly loved the experience of college. The freedom on every level. Freedom to explore. Freedom to experiment. Freedom to experience. I LOVED THAT PART.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the academics... the memorization and the formidable exams. Failing when you really tried. Failing when you hoped for luck. Failure is just a bitch no matter how you skin it. ;) So, looking at going back to school now, minus "the experience" with a whole lotta -it's not about the adventure, but pure academics mama!! Looking to gain knowledge and insight and to be honest, getting out there and makin some money! (how apt that a crazy rap song so perfectly fits this point in my life, "WAKE UP YOU NEED TO MAKE MONEY!!!")  - is all a little terrifying!</p>
<p>So, I've got my liquid courage and I'm setting out on a new adventure starting now... Wish me luck ;)</p>
<p>xoxo,</p>
<p>Jen</p>
