I feel like walls have been all the rage lately. Trump says build a wall. The Vatican says they don't wall, but it sure looks like they're snugged in tight with some pretty wide margins... Anyways, today it's me who needs the wall. I went to run errands with the littles and totally pissed off complete strangers! HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE!?! I literally walked from place to place, doing my business, only to look up and see scowls! grumpy faces! smiles that were absolutely NOT returned! I emailed a trainer for our dog and ended up in a pissing match about who had more to do!

So, here it is - we're all trying to make it and IT'S HARD! It's sooo much harder than I ever thought! But I know you're out there fighting to get yourself together and your kids in a better place! I think we all need to throw out alittle love and support today! Here's mine!
