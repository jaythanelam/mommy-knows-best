    <p>I watched a video the other day that was so moving, it actually moved me right off the couch to go and find our old copy of Dr. Seuss’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Oh-Places-Youll-Dr-Seuss/dp/0679805273/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1457548644&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=oh+the+places+you%27ll+go+by+dr.+seuss">OH, the Places You’ll GO!</a></p>

<p>The vid was a dad giving his now college bound daughter a book that he had passed around since her early kinder days. He asked each teacher/coach/friend to write something memorable so that by the time she had graduated high school it was invariably a year book to span years! I was so moved by the heartfelt gift that my heart just went splat! So ran out - I told you it got me moving - and purchased 3 more books. I’ve done some digging and pieced together this little poem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear Teacher, very grateful to you I would be,<br />
if you would please, please do this favor for me.<br />
I’m starting this gift when Ima is small,<br />
and plan to complete it by the time she is tall.<br />
Each teacher who helps her along the way,<br />
I hope will autograph –that is to say-<br />
Please add a note, a picture or song,<br />
A special memory can never be wrong.<br />
You have helped make her the person she is<br />
and you can take credit when they call her a whiz!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s early - I actually haven’t gotten all of our kiddos books back from our first run through, but I wanted to share! If you can do it - especially for families who move around - it’s a great way to keep those special moments for your kiddos ;)</p>

<p>mommyknowsbest seal of approval!</p>

<p>xoxo,
Jen</p>
