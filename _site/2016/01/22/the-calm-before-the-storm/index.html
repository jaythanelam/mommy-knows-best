    <p>We are awaiting this blizzard. I keep telling the kids harrowing tales of our days in Wisconsin where a snow storm of this magnitude wasn't snowpocalypse - it was a Tuesday :):) But just like the rest of our friends and neighbors, we are stocked, snuggled, and holding our breath for the first flakes to fall. Our morning walk took on new meaning as we pointed out things that might "disappear" after snowfall. It was pretty fun as we estimated that Evie (all 2 feet of her) is probably going to be one of first to fall!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-300" src="/assets/image-26-225x300.jpeg" alt="image" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>I was thinking back to other "clam before the storm" moments and immediately went to being pregnant. Before each one of my kiddos was born, I can remember a moment; a quiet - this is happening any minute but not <em>this</em> minute - moment. Our last daughter was almost born movie at the theater! Even then, as we bought our tickets and sat down I thought, wow! there is literally not another thing to do before we have this baby, so we movied and before the credits rolled, we were at the hospital.</p>
<p>I feel like in marriage you can sense the calm before the storm. You know your spouses moods and whims and can sense something building that will eventually surface. Or your kiddos frustration about something at school or some rule at home that's just waiting to bubble to the surface...</p>
<p>So now we're waiting... Packed in like sardines with the kids so excited they can barely sit still, already decked out in their snow gear!</p>
<p>Stay warm Stay Safe!</p>
<p>Xoxo,</p>
<p>Jen</p>
